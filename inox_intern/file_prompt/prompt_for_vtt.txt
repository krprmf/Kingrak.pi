Extract JSON in Thai from VTT text in the following format.
  [
    {{
    "start": "Start time of the period (timestamp HH:MM:SS)",
    "end": "End time of the period (timestamp HH:MM:SS)",
    "length_of_period_in_sec": "Difference from start to end in seconds (float)",
    "raw_data": "Exactly text from VTT in that period (string)",
    "tag": "A brief descriptor of the segment's content (string)",
    "topic": "The main subject or theme of the segment (string)",
    "summary": "Summary of the period's content (string)",
    "keyword": "Keywords related to the content (string)",
    "emotional_tone": "Overall emotional tone of the content segment (e.g., exciting, neutral, calm, urgent, enthusiastic, informative) (string)",
    "highlighted_segments": "Important or noteworthy moments in the content (e.g., key points, critical scenes, significant events) (string)",
    "informational_value": "Amount of new or useful information provided" (string)
    }}

  Parameters for config JSON:
  time_segmentation_resolution: {{low, medium, high}} or none (default: medium),
    Determines the granularity of time segments when exact_segment_count is not set:
    - 'high' results in more segments with finer and more detailed segmentation,
    - 'medium' results in a moderate number of segments balancing detail and coverage,
    - 'low' results in fewer segments with broader and less detailed segmentation,
    - 'none' means exact_segment_count is used to define the number of segments.

  exact_segment_count: int or None (default: None),
    Specifies the exact number of segments. Overrides time_segmentation_resolution if set.
    - If set to an integer, segments will be evenly distributed to cover all data, resulting in exactly that many segments,
    - If 'None', time_segmentation_resolution is used.

  raw_data: TRUE or FALSE, (default: FALSE)
    Specifies whether the "raw_data" field should be included in the output JSON.
    - If TRUE, the "raw_data" field will be included, containing the exact text from the VTT in that period. Please give only text without timecode.
    - If FALSE, the "raw_data" field will be excluded.

  time_start: list of timestamps (HH:MM:SS) or None (default: None)
    Specifies the exact start times for data segment extraction.
    - If 'None', time_start equal to exactly first timestamp in VTT text.

  time_end: list of timestamps (HH:MM:SS) or None (default: None)
    Specifies the exact end times for data segment extraction.
    - If 'None', time_end equal to exactly last timestamp in VTT text.

  "time_segmentation_resolution": {time_segmentation_resolution}
  "exact_segment_count": {exact_segment_count}
  "raw_data": {raw_data}
  "start_time": {start_time}
  "end_time": {end_time}

  Note: 
  - If parameters for config is blank meaning as default.
  
  Output should be a JSON array of segment data without any additional key or heading, and must add ',' delimiter every value.
